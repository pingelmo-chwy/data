<h2>Overview</h2>

The three-point line was adopted by the NBA during the 1979-80 season. Since then, the 3-point shot has continued to increase in importance and is now an integral part of the game. The new age of analytics in the NBA has also driven some extreme strategic behavior with regard to the 3-point shot. Look no further than the Houston Rockets to understand this change. Driven by stats-nerd GM Daryl Morey, the Rockets have looked to eliminate mid-range shots from their repetoire (http://es.pn/1erBBfi). This analysis will look at the 3-point shot as it has progressed in the 35 years since its introduction.

<h2>Explore Data</h2>

The NBA is played in a far different way than it was in 1980. Below is a snapshot showing 1980-2015, listing field goal attempts per game, 2-point attempts per game and 3-point attempts per game. Since 1980, field goal attempts per game have dropped from about 91 to 83 but 3-point shots have increased from 3 to just over 22.

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
# create data frame
shot_change <- nba %>% filter(season_end %in% c(1980,1990,2000,2010,2015)) %>% group_by(season_end) %>%summarize(FGA_per_game=mean(fga_game),x2PA_per_game=mean(x2pa_game),x3PA_per_game = mean(x3pa_game)) %>% select(season_end,FGA_per_game,x2PA_per_game,x3PA_per_game)

#display contents

```

<h2>League-Wide Trends</h2>

Since 1980, field goal attempts, 2-point attempts, free throw attempts and pace have all decreased, while 3-point attempts have increased. Unsurprisingly, field goal attempts per game mimics pace. NBA pace decreased steadily from 1980 through the early 2000s, as the half-court offense evolved. Pace has started to increase again, possibly as a factor of the 3-point shot.

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
# Pace
nba %>% filter(season_end>1980) %>% ggplot(aes(x=season_end,y=Pace,col=decade))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")+theme_fivethirtyeight()+theme(legend.position="none")+ggtitle(expression(atop("Pace per Game",atop("Colored by decade"))))

# Field Goal Attempts per Game
nba %>% filter(season_end>1980,fga_game<105) %>% ggplot(aes(x=season_end,y=fga_game,col=decade))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")+theme_fivethirtyeight()+theme(legend.position="none")+ggtitle(expression(atop("Field Goal Attempts per Game",atop("Colored by decade"))))

# 2-Point Attempts per Game
nba %>% filter(season_end>1980) %>% ggplot(aes(x=season_end,y=x2pa_game,col=decade))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")+theme_fivethirtyeight()+theme(legend.position="none")+ggtitle(expression(atop("2 Point Attempts per Game",atop("Colored by decade"))))

# Free Throw Attempts

# 3-Point Attempts per Game
nba %>% filter(season_end>1980) %>% ggplot(aes(x=season_end,y=x3pa_game,col=decade))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method="lm")+theme_fivethirtyeight()+theme(legend.position="none")+ggtitle(expression(atop("3 Point Attempts per Game",atop("Colored by decade"))))

```

<h2>The more 3-Point shots the better?</h2>

The share of field goal attempts that are 3-point shots has been increasing every year since 1980. This year, almost 27% of a team’s field goal attempts are 3-point shots. And for the first time in NBA history, a team is attempting more than 40% of their shots from 3-point territory. Can you guess who?

```{r,message=F,warning=F}
# 3 point share by season
nba %>% filter(season_end>1980) %>% ggplot(aes(x=season_end,y=x3pa_share,col=decade))+geom_smooth()+geom_point()+theme_fivethirtyeight()+ggtitle("Percent of Shots that are 3-Pointers")+theme(legend.position="none")
```

<h2>Future of NBA?</h2>
If you guessed the Houston Rockets, then you’d be correct. The Rockets have paced well above league average for the percent of shots that are 3-pointers.


```{r,message=F,warning=F}
# Rockets
HOU <- nba %>% filter(season_end>2000)
HOU$HOU <- ifelse(HOU$Tm=="HOU",1,0)

HOU %>% ggplot(aes(x=season_end,y=x3pa_share,size=HOU,col=HOU))+geom_point()+geom_smooth()+theme_fivethirtyeight()+theme(legend.position="none",plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.6),hjust=0))+scale_size_continuous(range=c(2,5))+ggtitle(expression(atop("Percent of Shots that are 3-Pointers",atop("Houston Rockets are blue dots"))))
