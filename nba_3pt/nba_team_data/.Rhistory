<h3>Overview</h3>
Every October, 30 NBA teams take the court, eager to start another 82 game journey with an eye on the ultimate prize - the Larry O'Brien Trophy. While every team still has a chance at 0-0, once enough data is collected, reliable patterns emerge that can help us differeniate contenders from pretenders. Today is March 5, 2015. We are 60 games, or about 73%, through the regular season. While team trends can still change as the season nears its end, this data can help us create a snapshot of those teams best positioned to capture that elusive trophy.
There are two separate datasets being analyzed. The first comes from basketball-reference.com (http://bit.ly/1AMgKJR) and contains every team and its associated stats from the 1970 season through the present season (2014-15). Included are basic stats like total points scored,  assists, turnovers and rebounds to some advanced efficiency metrics, such as effective field goal precentage, offensive rating and defensive rating. The other is a simple csv file contained every NBA champion and associated year since 1970.

<h3>Explore data</h3>
Now that the data has been loaded and cleaned, we can begin to explore it and build some interesting models that can help us determine estimated Wins and the probability of reaching the NBA championship.
I hypothesized that Offensive Rating, Defensive Rating, Wins, Offensive Rebounds, Assists and Effective Field Goal Percentage were most responsible for determining whether a team reached the finals. Before we get into some regressions to test that hypothesis, let's plot some historical data to see where past finals teams have landed compared to their peers that season.
In the below charts, the larger, light blue dots represent the teams that reached the NBA finals each season. The two most recent lockout shortened seasons (1998-99,2011-12) will fall well below the Loess Regression line when not plotting an efficiency metric.
<h5>**BLUE DOTS ARE FINALS TEAMS**</h5>
```{r message=F,warning=F,fig.width=10}
# Offensive Rating
nba %>% ggplot(aes(x=season_end,y=ORtg,size=finals,col=finals))+geom_point()+geom_smooth()+scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,4))+ggtitle("Offensive Rating")+theme_fivethirtyeight()+theme(legend.position="none",plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.6)))+xlab("Season End")+ylab("Offensive Rating")
# Defensive Rating - the lower the better
nba %>% ggplot(aes(x=season_end,y=DRtg,size=finals,col=finals))+geom_point()+geom_smooth()+scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,4))+ggtitle("Defensive Rating")+theme_fivethirtyeight()+theme(legend.position="none",plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.6)))+xlab("Season End")+ylab("Defensive Rating")
# Wins

# Offensive Rebounds

# Assists
nba %>% ggplot(aes(x=season_end,y=AST,size=finals,col=finals))+geom_point()+geom_smooth()+scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,4))+ggtitle("Assists")+theme_fivethirtyeight()+theme(legend.position="none",plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.6)))+xlab("Season End")+ylab("Assists")
# Effective Field Goal
nba %>% ggplot(aes(x=season_end,y=eFG,size=finals,col=finals))+geom_point()+geom_smooth()+scale_size_continuous(range=c(1,4))+ggtitle("Effective Field Goal")+theme_fivethirtyeight()+theme(legend.position="none",plot.title=element_text(size=rel(1.6)))+xlab("Season End")+ylab("eFG")
```
<p></p>
A few interesting high-level observations:
<ul style="list-style-type:square;list-style-position:inside;">
<li>Finals teams usually fall above the mean with regard to Offensive Rating, Defensive Rating, Effective Field Goal and Wins</li>
<li>Assists and Offensive Rebounds have been falling league-wide since the 1980s</li>
<li>Win totals seem to fall highest above the mean compared to the other variables</li>
</ul>
<h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
In order to determine the probability from a binary observation (Reach Finals or Not), we must use a logit regression. After running the regression a few times, Wins, Offensive Rating and Defensive Rating proved to be the most statistically significant in determining finals teams.
```{r}
summary(glm(finals~W+DRtg+ORtg,nba,family="binomial"))
```
<h3>Projecting Wins</h3>
If we are going to consider wins a major input into our logistic regression, then we must first project how many wins each team will finish with this year. We can do this with a multiple linear regression. I will only use Offensive Rating and Defensive Rating in order to avoid any multicollinearity issues.
```{r}
summary(lm(W~DRtg+ORtg,nba))
```
This simple model is very effective in determining the projected wins of teams with a R-Squared of .86.
Below are the projected wins for every team this season. Unsurprisingly, the Golden State Warriors sit atop the rankings with a projected 66 wins and gaudy 10.5 point Net rating (Offensive rating - Defensive Rating).
For comparison, check out FiveThirtyEight's NBA rankings (http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/nba-power-ratings-and-playoff-odds-waiting-on-durant/). It incorporates some different data (specifically Real Plus Minus) but the win totals are relatively close.
```{r}
nba %>% filter(season_end==2015) %>% mutate(projected_wins=25.165+2.547*ORtg-2.406*DRtg) %>% select(Tm,ORtg,DRtg,projected_wins) %>% arrange(desc(projected_wins))
```
<h3>And the next NBA Finals matchup is... </h3>

# Projected Wins and Champsionship probability
nba %>% filter(season_end==2015) %>% mutate(projected_wins=25.165+2.547*ORtg-2.406*DRtg,finals_prob=exp(-2.0415+.1221*projected_wins+.2077*ORtg-.278*DRtg)/(1+exp(-2.0415+.1221*projected_wins+.2077*ORtg-.278*DRtg))*100) %>% select(Tm,ORtg,DRtg,projected_wins,finals_prob) %>% arrange(desc(finals_prob))
```
<h3>Model Limitations</h3>
This model gives Golden State an incredible 75% probability to reach the NBA Championship. In a distant second are the Atlanta Hawks, with a 27% probability. Of course there are some limitations with this model. First, it does not take into account the incredibly difficult journey Golden State must take through the Western Conference playoffs. Of the top 10 teams listed above, 7 of them are in the Western Conference. Atlanta's journey will prove much easier, likely facing the Toronto Raptors or Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals. Another limitation with this model is its non-time-sensititve ratings. For instance, the Clevelend Cavaliers began the season at an under .500 clip, at one point sitting at 19-20. Since that moment, the team finally began to jell, improved both their Offensive and Defensive Ratings and is now 2nd in the East at 37-24. This model does not take into account this increased play, which likely would contribute to a higher probability of making the NBA finals.
<h3>Looking at past finals probabilities</h3>
Below are the probabilities for the every finals team since 1980.
Some observations:
<ul style="list-style-type:square;list-style-position:inside;">
<li>The last team with a near 75% probability to make the finals were the 2008 Boston Celtics, who eventually won the Championship. </li>
<li>The 1997 72-win Chicago Bulls had the highest probability in the set, with a 92% chance</li>
<li>The least likely contender? The 1999 New York Knicks, who would lose 4-1 to the San Antonio Spurs</li>
</ul>
